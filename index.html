<h2>About me</h2>
I was born in 2002, I dropped out of college in 2023. I was studying biology teaching at Hacettepe University. 
<br> 
I do not have joy of living, I am currently working as shopping assistant -aka sl*ve- at Migros.
<br>
I'm in debt, I made the biggest mistake in the world by buying a laptop, but it was necessary to have a laptop. 
<br> 
I wanna quit this job and wanna have meaningful things to do in this life.

<h3> My favorite sitcoms </h3>


<ul style="list-style-type:circle">

  <li><h4>The Good Place (4,5/5)</h4></li>

    This sitcom is my all times favorite. I really enjoyed watching it and love to bully people to watch this.
